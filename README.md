An intelligent traffic control system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor, predict, and optimize traffic flow in real time. This project aims to reduce congestion, improve road safety, and enhance transportation efficiency in urban environments.

## üîç Overview

The AI Traffic Management System utilizes computer vision, machine learning, and real-time data to:
- Detect vehicles and pedestrians
- Analyze traffic density and patterns
- Adjust traffic signal timings dynamically
- Predict traffic congestion and recommend alternate routes# Ai-traffic
